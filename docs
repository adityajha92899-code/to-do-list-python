# Project Overview

This project is a console-based To-Do List application.  
It allows users to add, view, and delete tasks.  

The project was developed using:
- Visual Studio Code
- Git for version control
- GitHub for hosting the repository

The main goal was to understand basic software development workflow.

1. Created a new folder for the project.
2. Wrote the Python code in VS Code.
3. Initialized Git using `git init`.
